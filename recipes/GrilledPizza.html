    <h2> Ingredients </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
      <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1/3 cup heavy cream</li>
      <li>1 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese, divided</li>
      <li>1 pound prepared pizza dough</li>
      <li>8 slices fresh mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds; stir in cream. Add 2/3 cup Parmesan cheese, and stir until smooth. Let Alfredo sauce cool to room temperature, about 15 minutes. </li>
      <li>Meanwhile, preheat a gas grill with all burners on High for 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
      <li>Divide pizza dough in half. Shape each portion of the pizza dough into an 8 to 10-inch disc. Reduce the flame on half the grill burners to Low, to create areas of direct and indirect heat.</li>
      <li>Carefully place discs of dough, one at a time, onto the grill over direct heat. Close the cover. Let dough grill until the bottom is just barely cooked and shows char marks, 1 to 3 minutes.</li>
      <li>Turn crust ninety degrees (do not flip dough over). Grill until crust shows light grill marks, 1 to 3 minutes.</li>
      <li>Move pizza dough to indirect heat. Spoon Alfredo sauce over dough. Top each crust with four slices mozzarella cheese. Sprinkle remaining 1/3 cup Parmesan cheese evenly over pizzas.</li>
      <li>Grill until cheese is melted, about 3 minutes. Carefully remove pizza from the grill.</li>
      <li>Preheat the ovenâ€™s broiler. Broil pizza until cheese is golden, about 5 minutes. Allow pizza to rest a few minutes before cutting into wedges.</li>
